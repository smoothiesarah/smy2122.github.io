# This is my first website - welcome!

I can add text

* and lists
* with extra bullets

I can *italicize* and **bold**

This is a [link](https://www.google.com) to a good data science tool, Google.com!
Later, I will be able to add a shortcut to another page on my site, such as the [About](about.html) page.

I can still use R and show this random code and plot:
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = runif(100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )

plot_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

# Here is a new section

Here's a JPG I will embed:
